module SessionsConsumersHelper

  # Logging a user in is simple with
  #the help of the session method defined
  #by Rails.

 # We can treat session as if it were a hash,
 #and assign to it as follows:

    # Logs in the given consumer.
  def log_in(consumer)
    session[:consumer.id] = consumer.id #session[:] is provided from rails.
  end
# ***********************************************



  #Storing a userâ€™s (encrypted) id and remember token as permanent cookies on the browser.
  # It uses cookies to create permanent cookies for the user id and remember token
  def remember(consumer)
    consumer.remember #remember is called from class. Remember consumer in a persistent session.
    cookies.permanent.signed[:consumer_id] = consumer.id
    cookies.permanent[:remember_token] = consumer.remember_token
  end
  #permanent = rails save for 20 years method.
  #signed = rails encrypting method.
  # *********************************************


  # Returns the current logged-in user (if any).
  ####check in console with a non existant record
  ####that this raises no exception and returns nil if id is invalid.
  def current_consumer
    #if @current_consumer.nil?
    #   @current_consumer = Consumer.find_by(id: session[:consumer_id])
    #else
    #   @current_consumer
    #end

    #***** THIS LINE DOES THE SAME *****
    @current_consumer ||= Consumer.find_by(id: session[:consumer_id])
  end
  #A user is logged in if there is a current user in the session, i.e.,
  #if current_user is not nil.
  #so we do not get error in rails server.

 ##### Returns true if the user is logged in, false otherwise.
  def logged_in?
    !current_consumer?

   # Logs out the current user.
  def log_out
